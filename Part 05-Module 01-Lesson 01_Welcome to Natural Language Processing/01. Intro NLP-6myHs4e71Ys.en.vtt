00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.439
Hi, and welcome to

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.480
the Natural Language Processing Nanodegree.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.460
My name is Luis Serrano and I'm

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.850
the curriculum leader at the School of Artificial Intelligence at Udacity.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.475
We are delighted to have you with us in this journey.

00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:20.230
Natural language Processing is one of

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.629
the most exciting and fastest growing applications in machine learning.

00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:24.954
And by being here,

00:00:24.954 --> 00:00:26.679
you are a part of this revolution.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.050
This Nanodegree will have three main parts.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.000
In the first part, you will learn the basics of

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.640
language processing and some very interesting probabilistic algorithms.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.850
You will then have the chance to shine in the project,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.450
building a model for part of speech tagging using hidden Markov models.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.840
In the second part, you will go deeper into some of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.600
the most exciting deep learning based language models.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.370
For the project, you'll be building

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:50.489
a machine translation model using deep neural networks.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.480
And in the third part, you'll learn speech recognition and voice user interface.

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:55.739
For the project, you'll be building

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.145
an end-to-end speech recognition model using deep neural networks.

00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.859
We have some great instructors who will guide you along the way.

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.935
Aside from myself, we'll have Arpan Chakraborty.

00:01:04.935 --> 00:01:06.840
Arpan enjoys building computer vision and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.540
machine learning courses at Georgia Tech and Udacity.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.550
Jay Alamar is a computer scientist and

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.730
investment principle with a very popular machine learning blog.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.700
Dana Sheahen is an electrical engineer with a master's in computer science,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.500
and a love for all things AI.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.719
So, let's dive in and become an expert in Natural Language Processing
