Hello and welcome to voice user interfaces.

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:08.310
A VUI is a speech platform that enables humans to communicate with machines by voice.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.089
To help you learn how to design voice user interfaces we have Dana Sheahen.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:13.345
Hello.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:17.269
This is a great topic and I'm delighted to have the chance to teach it.

00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:20.354
VUIs used to be the stuff of science fiction.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.324
Movies and TV shows featuring spaceship crews

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:26.745
that communicated verbally with their computers seemed fantastic.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:29.734
But that fantastic future is here now.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:34.678
Voice enabled agents are becoming commonplace on our phones, computers,

00:00:34.677 --> 00:00:37.769
cars to the point that many people may no

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.490
longer think of these systems as artificial intelligence at all.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.960
Under the hood, though, there is a lot going on.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.270
Audio sound waves from voice must be converted into

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.228
language texts using machine learning algorithms and probabilistic models.

00:00:53.228 --> 00:00:56.759
The resulting text must be reasoned-over using

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:01.064
AI logic to determine the meaning and formulate a response.

00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:04.480
Finally, the response text must be converted

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.709
back into understandable speech again with machine learning tools.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.655
These three parts constitute a general pipeline

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:16.519
for building an end to end voice enabled application.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:19.950
Each part employs some aspect of a AI.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.640
And that's why we're here.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.665
In this lesson we'll go through

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:28.304
a VUI system's overview and talk about some current VUI applications.

00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:33.055
We'll focus on conversational AI applications where you'll learn

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:37.180
some VUI best practices and why we need to think differently

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.000
about user design for voice as compared to other interface mediums.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.700
Finally, you will put these ideas into practice

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.959
by building your own conversational AI application.
