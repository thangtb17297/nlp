00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.698
One of the most popular application areas for voice system today is conversational AI.

00:00:10.698 --> 00:00:14.629
We've just seen a demonstration of the Amazon Alexa and a variety of

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.969
Amazon skills that can run on Amazon echo devices using voice only interface.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:25.120
We're fortunate to have a subject matter expert on this technology with us now.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.589
I'd like to introduce Jeff Blankenburg-- Alexa Evangelist at Amazon.

00:00:30.588 --> 00:00:34.603
He's here to educate us on the Amazon Echo and Alexa.

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:36.714
Jeff, we're so glad you're here.

00:00:36.715 --> 00:00:39.590
Thanks. Dana, thanks for inviting me to be a part of this.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.679
I'm really excited about what Udacity is doing to help developers learn about Alexa.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.868
We are too. In this lesson,

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:49.115
we're going to learn how to build our own Alexa skill.

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.140
Jeff, for a little background.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.780
Could you tell us how Conversational AI at

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.439
Amazon got started and have the Echo and Alexa came to be?

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:02.524
Sure. The original inspiration for the Amazon Echo was the Star Trek computer.

00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:04.400
We wanted to create a computer in the cloud that

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.129
controlled everything entirely by your voice.

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:08.329
You could ask it questions,

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:09.468
turn lights on and off,

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:10.947
and order stuff for yourself,

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:13.309
and it's easy to talk in a natural way.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.222
We're a ways off from a Star Trek vision,

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:17.113
but that was our inspiration.

00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:18.989
The cool thing about all of this,

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:22.560
is that we're really at a tipping point for so many elements of the technology.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.885
We're still a long way from being able to do things the way humans do things.

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:29.650
But we're still solving unbelievably complex problems everyday.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.760
And as we've seen over the past two years,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.745
conversational computing is popular.

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:37.239
I think a primary reason for this is because it's so accessible.

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:39.819
Echo devices are designed for families to use together.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.930
What we hear from parents and other customers is that

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.930
Alexa provides great fun for the whole family.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.329
It's clear. The conversational aspect makes all the difference.

00:01:49.328 --> 00:01:53.108
In the past we've seen voice systems on phones that step you

00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:57.473
through the menu but under some circumstances that can be frustrating.

00:01:57.474 --> 00:02:02.230
It sounds like Alexa is a big step up from that kind of voice interface.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.269
Exactly. The phone systems you're talking about took

00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:07.750
an approach the industry calls graph based interaction.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.318
I think this was a choice of necessity because most phone system technologies were built

00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:15.513
before we had some of the rich Conversational UI that we have today.

00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:19.675
Graph based interaction mainly focuses on asking pointed questions

00:02:19.675 --> 00:02:24.625
in a prescribed order and only accepting specific terms as responses.

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:26.650
You've seen this plenty of times before when

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.629
you can't move forward in the system until you provide

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:30.549
your user ID or you can't specify

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.155
your destination until you provided the location you'll be starting from.

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:36.163
Here's the example: Alexa,

00:02:36.163 --> 00:02:38.138
open graph travel agent.

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.240
Where are you flying from?

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.705
I want to fly from Columbus to San Francisco on October 9th.

00:02:43.705 --> 00:02:45.574
You're flying from Columbus.

00:02:45.574 --> 00:02:48.260
Got it. Where do you want to go?

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:51.049
San Francisco on Delta flight 722.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.444
Okay. You're trying to find a flight from Columbus to San Francisco.

00:02:55.443 --> 00:02:57.938
Which airline do you want to use?

00:02:57.938 --> 00:03:00.133
You can see how that can get a little frustrating.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.698
The alternative frame based allows the user to drive the interaction.

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.590
You can say the words that make sense to you.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.550
You can make requests in the order you prefer when it makes sense and you can jump

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.425
to the part of the menu you want to be in without having to memorize a list of options.

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:17.880
Alexa. Open frame travel agent.

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:20.049
Where are you flying from?

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.659
I want to fly from Columbus to San Francisco on October 9th.

00:03:23.658 --> 00:03:29.109
Okay. You're trying to find a flight from Columbus to San Francisco on October 9th.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.525
Which airline do you want to use?

00:03:31.525 --> 00:03:33.014
That's so exciting.

00:03:33.014 --> 00:03:37.705
It's exciting because it means there's a lot of flexibility in what we can build,

00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:40.664
when we design our own Alexa skills.

00:03:40.663 --> 00:03:45.068
But how do we know what we want to have Alexa listen for?

00:03:45.068 --> 00:03:49.628
And how does that translate to what we want in response?

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:53.888
In the example, you just showed Alexa was very accommodating.

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.954
One of the cool things about building a Voice User Interface or VUI,

00:03:57.954 --> 00:04:00.650
is how you define interactions with your users.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.900
You get to define a series of actions that the user can perform which we call intense.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.044
If our voice skill was a DVD player,

00:04:07.044 --> 00:04:09.055
our intense might be play,

00:04:09.055 --> 00:04:11.468
pause, stop, and eject.

00:04:11.468 --> 00:04:13.818
Our DVD player doesn't have a pizza button

00:04:13.818 --> 00:04:17.014
because DVD players don't traditionally make pizzas.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:20.910
We then create a set of sample statements which we call utterances that

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.004
help Alexa understand which intent to use when a user says something.

00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:27.360
Going back to the DVD player example,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.740
someone might say "start the movie" and they would expect the play intent to happen.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.355
But they might also say play or go or begin

00:04:35.355 --> 00:04:39.649
or it's show time and they would expect to have the same reaction.

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:41.240
The intention is to play the movie.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.845
These example utterances help elect to understand

00:04:43.845 --> 00:04:47.654
which intent should be called when the user says something to a skill.

00:04:47.653 --> 00:04:53.459
I see. So if we think about a sort of script we want our user to have with Alexa,

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:57.394
we can come up with a number of different ways they might converse.

00:04:57.394 --> 00:05:02.319
I guess more user testing could help us expand our list of better answers as well.

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.500
How do we model what the user will say?

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.879
This is one of my favorite questions to answer.

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.389
I spend a great deal of my time working with software developers that are building

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.519
their first or second skill for

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:19.735
Alexa and that is one of the most common questions I encounter.

00:05:19.735 --> 00:05:23.734
What's the best tool for modeling my conversation with my users?

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:28.258
The surprising or maybe not so surprising answer is to grab a couple of your colleagues,

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.720
friends, and complete strangers and ask them to naturally request what outcome they need.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.779
Take some notes because you will quickly discover that every person is

00:05:36.778 --> 00:05:39.975
going to approach the process of this a slightly different way,

00:05:39.975 --> 00:05:42.925
and your skills should be able to accommodate all of them.

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.660
An example of this, when you ask Alexa for the weather.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.774
You could say what does the temperature outside?

00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:49.298
Or how hot is it?

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:50.758
But you can also just say,

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.319
Alexa, what's it like?

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.850
In Mountain View, it's 58 degrees with cloudy skies.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:03.535
Today, you can look for lots of clouds with a high of 69 degrees and a low of 50 degrees.

00:06:03.535 --> 00:06:06.000
There are hundreds of ways to indicate that you want

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.134
to know the weather without saying it explicitly.

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:10.644
That sounds like fun.

00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:15.014
Students could even ask others in the classroom and sort of crowdsource,

00:06:15.014 --> 00:06:17.365
a list of possible utterances.

00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:19.305
But before we start building a skill,

00:06:19.305 --> 00:06:24.283
are there some other guidelines we need to keep in mind for a good user experience?

00:06:24.283 --> 00:06:26.882
I think you're touching on the best practices in VUI

00:06:26.882 --> 00:06:30.359
design that we need to remain aware of as we build skills.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.050
There are a number of ideas to consider when designing a voice only interface.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.610
There are different from design of say,

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.334
text or graphical interfaces.

00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:39.605
This sounds important.

00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:41.050
Let's dig a little deeper.
