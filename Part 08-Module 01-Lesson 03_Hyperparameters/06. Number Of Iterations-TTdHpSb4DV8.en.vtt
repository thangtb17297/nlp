00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:06.490
To choose the right
number of iterations or number

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.490
of epochs for our
training step, the metric

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.030
we should have our eyes on
is the validation error.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.910
The intuitive manual way
is to have the model train

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.190
for as many epochs
or iterations that it

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.000
takes, as long as the validation
error keeps decreasing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.109
Luckily, however, we can use a
technique called early stopping

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.350
to determine when to
stop training a model.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.590
Early stopping roughly works
by monitoring the validation

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.340
error, and stopping the training
when it stops decreasing.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.100
We must be a little flexible
though in defining the stopping

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.000
trigger.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.520
Validation error will
often move back and forth,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.350
even if it's on
a downward trend.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.420
So instead of
stopping the training

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.260
the first time we see the
validation error increase,

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.320
we can instead stop the training
if the validation error has not

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.759
improved in the
last 10 or 20 steps.

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:00.079
TensorFlow has support
for early stopping.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.439
Check the text below
the video for how

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:06.060
to implement it in TensorFlow.
