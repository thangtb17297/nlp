00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.383
Now I have to ask you this question and

00:00:03.383 --> 00:00:06.714
likely many of our students are pondering it as well.

00:00:06.714 --> 00:00:09.390
So, will AI replace all our jobs?

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.139
Will it take over the world?

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:14.379
How worried should we be?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.109
I was waiting for that priceless question.

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.725
First and foremost, our leader, Ginni Rometty,

00:00:20.725 --> 00:00:27.010
has coined the term Augmented Intelligence, not artificial intelligence.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.140
Our capabilities are here not to supplant jobs but to help

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.134
remove the mundane tasks so workers can focus on the core mission.

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:41.695
Yes, they will require new training and we call that

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:48.899
new collar jobs and that is exactly what our partnership with Udacity is providing.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.780
So yes, we are rapidly approaching an inflection point in

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.679
human history where Augmented Intelligence will

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:00.609
exceed human intelligence and debates about humans

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.000
versus machines have become part of our common vernacular.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.430
How can we prepare our next generation of students to compete?

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.959
One positive step being taken in our K

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:17.849
through 12 schools is a growing emphasis on STEM: science technology,

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:20.293
engineering and mathematics education,

00:01:20.293 --> 00:01:23.128
plus modern coding skills.

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:26.099
For example, IBM's P-TECH program,

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:29.430
where students graduate with a high school diploma and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.090
an associate degree in computers or engineering.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.853
But STEM education is not enough,

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:40.488
and that is where our partnership comes in.

00:01:40.489 --> 00:01:43.564
Jeffrey Calvin in his book,

00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:49.423
"Humans Are Underrated: What High Achievers Know That Brilliant Machines

00:01:49.424 --> 00:01:55.805
Never Will," argues that it is right brain skills like creativity,

00:01:55.805 --> 00:01:59.989
imagination, collaboration, holistic thinking,

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.859
and emotional intelligence that are the greatest source of

00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:08.340
competitive advantage for humans versus machines.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.050
Thank you so much for giving us such a comprehensive tour of

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.384
natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

00:02:16.383 --> 00:02:19.698
Absolutely, our mission at IBM Watson is to bring

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:24.525
the cutting edge cognitive technologies within reach of everyone.

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.710
There's no reason for Augmented Intelligence to stay locked

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.800
up in research labs and in the hands of a few companies.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.180
With the power of IBM Watson behind you I

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.849
can't even imagine what applications you'll end up building.

00:02:38.848 --> 00:02:41.000
Let's get started today.
