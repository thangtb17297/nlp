00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
Natural Language Processing, even with its current challenges,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:05.490
holds a lot of promise.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.351
To help us better understand how NLP is being used today,

00:00:09.351 --> 00:00:13.285
we have with us Armen Pischdotchian from IBM.

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:15.314
Hello. My name is Armen.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:19.230
In my current role as an Academic Tech Mentor I lecture and conduct

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.234
workshops using Watson Cognitive Services for universities,

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:27.129
highschools, STEM programs, and the girls who code.

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:32.689
We also run hackathons using IBM Watson Cognitive Services that reside on Bluemix,

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.914
our platform as a service.

00:00:34.914 --> 00:00:40.588
Another aspect of the work that we do is often wearing a Solution Architect cap because

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:43.798
most universities are also working with clients who

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:47.689
use the academic environment as their development arena.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:51.719
I especially look forward to such extended engagements where I strive

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.835
to build a proof of concept for such clients. And you're right, Arpun.

00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:02.490
We are seeing an increasing number of projects that use NLP in one way or another.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.819
And it is being used today, not in isolation,

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:11.189
but embedded as part of intelligent end to end solutions that use a number of

00:01:11.188 --> 00:01:14.143
different technologies often augmented with

00:01:14.144 --> 00:01:17.605
understanding vision and not just a bag of words.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:23.800
I see. So, what would you say is the primary role of NLP in such a system?

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.128
NLP is characterized as a hard problem in computer science.

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:33.015
Human language is rarely precise or plainly spoken.

00:01:33.015 --> 00:01:37.064
To understand human language is to understand not only the words

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:41.468
but the concepts and how they are linked together to create meaning.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:45.411
Despite language being one of the easiest things for humans to learn,

00:01:45.412 --> 00:01:47.819
the ambiguity of language is what makes

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:53.069
Natural Language Processing a difficult problem for computers to master.

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.191
For example, consider this phrase,

00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:58.650
this fountain is not drinking water.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.569
A cognitive system that can tokenize, parse,

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.859
and annotate the phrase will infer that

00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:08.210
the fountain is currently not engaged in the act of drinking water.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.555
But we know that it means we should not drink the water from this fountain.

00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:17.259
Today's systems go beyond analyzing utterances.

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:19.848
They understand the relationship of the words,

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:23.718
the context surrounding the utterances.

00:02:23.718 --> 00:02:28.859
For example, why do I need to scan through dozens of airbnb reviews to find

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.755
a suitable accommodation when I can better describe what I want in my own words?

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:37.519
I am looking for an apartment with views of the river,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.750
facing the Manhattan skyline,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.128
but I don't want a noisy and smelly location.

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:45.948
I expect the cognitive system to uncover

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.895
customer reviews that depict exactly the criteria that I am seeking.

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:53.604
And that's where NLP comes in.

00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:57.169
It can help understand the user's intentions and what

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.919
they like or dislike and process large volumes of

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.530
text to better infer the context of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.033
our conversations and just exactly what we mean by what we say.

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.174
Here's an example for you, Arpun.

00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:16.474
A wise man is absolutely not the same as a wise guy.

00:03:16.473 --> 00:03:21.000
Consider this, a slim chance is the same as a fat chance.
