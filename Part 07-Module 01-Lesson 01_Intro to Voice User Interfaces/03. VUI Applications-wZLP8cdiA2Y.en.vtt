00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.785
VUI applications are becoming more and more common place.

00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:07.048
There are a few reasons driving this.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.115
First of all voice is natural for humans.

00:00:10.115 --> 00:00:15.060
It's effortless for us to converse by voice compared to reading and typing.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.315
And secondly, it turns out it's also fast.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:23.309
Speaking into a text transcriber is three times faster than typing.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:26.309
In addition there are times when it is just too

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:32.353
distracting to look at a visual interface like when you're walking or driving.

00:00:32.353 --> 00:00:35.908
With the advent of better and more accessible speech recognition and

00:00:35.908 --> 00:00:41.269
speech synthesis technologies a number of applications have flourished.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.960
For example voice interfaces can be found in cars,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.130
drivers can initiate and answer phone calls given receive

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.859
navigation commands and even receive

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.655
texts and e-mail without ever taking their eyes off the road.

00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:00.210
Other applications in web and mobile have been around

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.939
for a few years now but are getting better and better.

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.715
Dictation applications,

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:11.775
Leverage speech recognition technologies to make putting thoughts into words a snap.

00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:17.469
Translation applications, Leverage speech recognition and speech synthesis as well

00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:20.078
as some reasoning logic in between to

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:23.818
convert speech in one language to speech in another.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:26.620
If you've tried any of these you know it's not quite

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.319
a universal translator but it's pretty

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:31.569
amazing to be able to communicate through one of

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.805
these apps with someone you couldn't even speak to before.

00:01:35.805 --> 00:01:42.129
One of the most exciting innovations in VUI today is conversational AI technology.

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:44.709
We can now carry on a conversation with

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.280
a cloud based system that incorporates well-tuned speech recognition,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.995
some functionality and speech synthesis into one system or device.

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:57.385
Examples include Apple's Siri,

00:01:57.385 --> 00:02:03.069
Microsoft's Cortana, Google home and Amazon's Alexa on Eco.

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.289
Conversational AI really captures our imaginations because it seems to be

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:13.684
an early step toward the more general AI we've seen in science fiction movies.

00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:17.500
The Home Assistant devices in this category are quite flexible.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.788
In addition to running a search or giving you the weather these devices can

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:26.146
interface with other devices on the internet linked with your accounts if you want,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.598
fetching save data, the list goes on.

00:02:29.598 --> 00:02:34.774
Even better, development with these technologies is accessible to all of us.

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:37.300
You really only need your computer to get started

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.930
creating your own application in conversational AI.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.569
The heavy lifting of speech recognition and

00:02:43.568 --> 00:02:49.489
speech synthesis have been done for you and turned into a cloud based APIs.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.030
The field is new and just waiting for

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.585
smart developers to imagine and implement the next big thing.

00:02:56.585 --> 00:02:59.455
There's a lot of opportunity out there to come up with

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:03.000
any voice and able application you can think of.
