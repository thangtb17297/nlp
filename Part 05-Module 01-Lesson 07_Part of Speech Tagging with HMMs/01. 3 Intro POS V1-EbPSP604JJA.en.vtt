Hi again. Welcome to the part of speech tagging section.

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:07.049
In this section, we'll study a very interesting problem which consists in

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.425
tagging sentences with their parts of speech like noun,

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.570
verb, adjective et cetera.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.849
These types of models are particularly useful

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.429
for applications like grammar or spelling checkers.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.234
We'll use several methods to implement part of speech tagging

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:23.480
including Hidden Markov Model. Let's begin.
