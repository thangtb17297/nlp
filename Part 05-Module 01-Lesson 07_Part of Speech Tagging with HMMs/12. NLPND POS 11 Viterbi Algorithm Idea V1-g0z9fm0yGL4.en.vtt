00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.569
So in the last video, we saw a method of removing paths which

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.290
brought our calculations down from 81 paths to four.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.500
But that was still a bit lucky and it required a lot of thinking.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.814
We want a better algorithm. So let's think.

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:17.504
Let's look at only these two paths and let's merge them.

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:20.250
So now, what happens at say this point.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.664
There are two ways to get to that point.

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:24.509
And here are the two ways.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.330
And the probabilities for the mini path in the left

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.629
is much smaller than that of the mini path on the right.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.969
So, we're really just concerned with the mini path on the right,

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:35.710
and we can forget about the other one.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.250
At the end of the day,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.549
that's what we want.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:40.294
For every possible state,

00:00:40.295 --> 00:00:44.500
we will record the highest probability path that ends in that state.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.034
This known as the Viterbi algorithm.

00:00:47.034 --> 00:00:50.000
We'll develop it more thoroughly in the next video.
