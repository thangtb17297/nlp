00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
So, let's start with some friends.

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.120
Let's say we have our friend, Mary,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.490
our friend, Jane, and our friend, Will.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.699
And we want to tag the sentence: Mary saw Will.

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:09.899
And to figure this out,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.734
we have some exciting data in the form of some sentences,

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.669
which are "Mary saw Jane.",

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:15.929
and "Jane so Will."

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.914
And these are tagged as follows.

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:20.939
Mary, Jane, and Will are tagged as nouns,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.370
and saw is tagged as a verb.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.530
On our first algorithm it's going to be very simple.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.089
We're just going to tag each word with the most common part of speech.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.410
So, we make a little table where the rows are

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.350
the words and the columns are the parts of speech,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.085
and we write down how often each one appears in the existing data.

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:40.820
For the first row, Mary appears once as a noun,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.395
and zero times as a verb.

00:00:42.395 --> 00:00:45.540
Then saw appears zero times as a noun,

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.390
and two as a verb, et cetera.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.469
And then when we want to tag our new sentence, Mary saw Will,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.449
then we go word by word and pick

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.075
the most common part of speech associated with that word.

00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:00.075
So, that's the largest number in the corresponding row.

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:03.679
We start with Mary which in the table gets associated to noun,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.239
thanks to this one over here.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.129
Then saw gets associated with verb and Will gets associated with noun, and we're done.
