00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Okay. So now let's complicate the problem a little bit.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.205
We still have Mary, Jane and Will.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.615
And let's say there's a new member of the gang called Spot.

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:12.099
And now our data is formed by the following four sentences,

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.140
Mary, Jane can see Will.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.065
Spot will see Mary.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:17.865
Will Jane spot Mary?

00:00:17.864 --> 00:00:20.039
And Mary will pat Spot.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.914
And these are tied in someway.

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:24.734
We'll show you later. And we want to tag the sentence,

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.714
Jane will spot Will.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:29.370
So let's try a lookup table and I won't fill it in,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.530
but let's say we can fill it in based on the data.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.495
What's a potential problem here?

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:36.119
Well, when we look at the first pair Jane will,

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.664
we notice that that's not in the data.

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:39.765
This pair of words never appears.

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:41.969
But somehow, it's a pair that makes sense.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.850
So, a problem with bigrams or n-grams in general is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.149
that sometimes every pair or every n-gram doesn't appear,

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.689
and then we have no way to fill in the extra information.

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:55.129
So for this, we'll introduce hidden mark of models.
