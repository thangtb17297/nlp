00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.784
So, here we are, we have our diagram,

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:03.794
which is called a Trellis diagram.

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:07.699
And in here, we're going to find the path of the highest probability.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.294
Let's recall that transition and emission probability tables.

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.919
We'll record the emission probabilities and we won't

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.800
record the transmission ones yet because they will look too messy.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.750
But we'll simplify this graph a bit.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.920
First, let's remove all the edges of probability zero.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.395
And now, let's remove all the vertices with probability zero.

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:28.079
The reason is that, any path that goes through these edges or

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.409
vertices will have probability zero as a probability that,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.405
that path gives of the sentence,

00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:37.365
is the product of all the probabilities at the edges and vertices.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.530
And finally, since we need the path to go from start to finish,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.484
we'll remove the edges that don't take us to the end.

00:00:43.484 --> 00:00:44.880
And now, we need to find

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.870
the maximum probability path in this Trellis, a much simpler one.

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:53.729
So, here's a quiz, how many paths do we have to check now?
