00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.214
Okay, here's the problem we're going to solve in this section.

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:05.394
We have a sentence, for example,

00:00:05.394 --> 00:00:07.264
Mary had a little lamb,

00:00:07.264 --> 00:00:09.774
and we need to figure out which words are nouns,

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:13.225
verbs, adjectives, adverbs, et cetera.

00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:16.669
Now, a thorough knowledge in grammar is not needed in this section only to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.140
know that words are normally given these labels or tags.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.010
For this sentence, the tags are noun for Mary, verb for had,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.550
determinant for a, adjective for little,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.410
and again noun for lamb.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.890
These labels are called parts of speech and

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.414
so this problem is called part-of-speech tagging,

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:38.920
and what we'll do in this section is develop some models that will help us label

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.880
these words with their corresponding part of speech based on existing label data.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.995
The main model that we'll learn today is a hidden Markov model.

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.699
So for simplicity, in this section we'll only be using three parts of speech.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.540
Along in the project, you'll use more.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.390
The ones we'll use are noun.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.829
So, things like house,

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.189
car, Mary, Bob, et cetera.

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:59.679
Then, we have a modal verb,

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.520
which is normally used with another verb.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.160
These are words like can,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.140
would, should, may, et cetera.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.820
And finally, we'll have verbs,

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:09.594
which are actions like run, see,

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:11.789
jump, eat, walk, et cetera.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.460
So, when we have a sentence like,

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:17.079
John can run, we tag it with the parts of speech as follows.

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.439
John is the noun,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.599
can is the modal verb, and run is the verb.
