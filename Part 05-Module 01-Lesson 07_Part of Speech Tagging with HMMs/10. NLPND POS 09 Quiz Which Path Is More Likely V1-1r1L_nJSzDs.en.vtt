00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
And the answer is four.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.480
And here are the four paths we have to check.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.720
They are noun noun noun noun, noun modal noun noun, noun noun verb noun,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.050
and noun modal verb noun.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.535
Now, let me write down

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.230
the probabilities in the edges and the vertices.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.800
So new quiz. Which one of these gives us the sentence with the highest probability?
