00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.035
Correct. The answer is 81.

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:04.845
And the reason is that we have three possibilities for game,

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.120
three for will, three for spot, and three for Will.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.474
Here are the 81 possibilities.

00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:13.049
So this is not so bad.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.635
We could check 81 products of four things and find the largest one.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:21.040
But what if we have say 30 parts of speech and we need to take a sentence of 10 words.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.794
Then we have 30 to the 10 possibilities.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.235
That starts being pretty large.

00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:27.059
In general, it's exponential and we don't want to

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:28.890
have to check exponentially many things.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.050
We need to have a smarter algorithm.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.980
So, here's another way to see this 81 combinations as paths.

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:36.609
Here we have our sentence,

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:38.549
and here we have our states.

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:44.804
The start state and then three choices for each word and then the end state.

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:49.534
This gives us the three times three times three times three, which is 81.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:54.494
Notice that each combination of four states also gives us a path from left to right.

00:00:54.494 --> 00:00:56.894
For example, the combination noun,

00:00:56.895 --> 00:01:00.010
modal, verb, noun, gives us this path over here.

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.689
Unless we called that for each element in the path vertices and edges,

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:06.719
we have a corresponding probability which comes from

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.114
the emission and the transition probability tables.

00:01:10.114 --> 00:01:15.159
And then, we multiply these probabilities to get the total probability of the path.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.609
So, at the end of the day,

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.439
what we have to do is find the path from left to right,

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.629
that gives us the highest probability.

00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:23.670
We'll do that in the next video.
