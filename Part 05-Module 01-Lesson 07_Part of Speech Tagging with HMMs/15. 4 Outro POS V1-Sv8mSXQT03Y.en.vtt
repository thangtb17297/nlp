Great job. In this section,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.849
you have learned Hidden Markov Models and how to apply them to part-of-speech tagging.

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.939
Now in the project, you will have the chance to apply this algorithm in

00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:13.640
a real data set of sentences to create your own part-of-speech tagger. Let's go.
