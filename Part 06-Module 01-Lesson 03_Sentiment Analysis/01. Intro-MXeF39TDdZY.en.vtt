00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720
Hi, this is Louis.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.205
Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis section.

00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:06.140
Sentiment Analysis is probably one of

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.785
the most popular uses of natural language processing these days.

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:13.294
Sentiment Analysis has become an important tool for many purposes.

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:15.800
For example: understanding customer sentiment

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.410
around the company for making investment decisions,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.960
getting a feedback signal for social media and advertising campaigns,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.519
as a quantitative measure for book and movie reviews, and so on.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.679
This will be a short section since the topic is

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.155
simple once you know classification algorithms,

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.714
but it will have two labs.

00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:34.729
Both labs will train a classifier and movie reviews in

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:37.744
the Internet Movie Database or IMDB dataset.

00:00:37.744 --> 00:00:39.559
The first lab will do it with

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.109
a regular supervised learning classifier by

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.829
looking at a review as an unorganized collection of words.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.519
The second lab will exploit the sequentiality of the sentences and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.130
will train a more accurate classifier using a recurring neural network.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.940
If you need a refresher on recurrent neural networks,

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:59.000
please check the extracurricular material in the Nanodegree for

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.929
a full refresher section on RNN's and one LSDM's.
