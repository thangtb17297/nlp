00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
So, let's go to probability distributions.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.275
Let's say we have a coin,

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:05.755
and we toss it twice.

00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:08.519
Let's say we get one heads and one tails.

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.019
What would we think about this coin?

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.294
Well, it could be a fair coin, right?

00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:16.884
It could also be slightly biased towards either heads or tails.

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:19.325
We don't have enough data to be sure.

00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:22.589
So, let's say that our verdict is that we think it's fair,

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.179
but with not much confidence.

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.355
So, let's think of the probability p that this coin lands on heads.

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:30.940
With a little bit of confidence,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.310
p is one half,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.344
but it could be a lot of other values.

00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:37.964
So, the probability distribution for p is something like this graph.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:39.480
Higher at one half,

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:41.640
but a bit even in the entire interval,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.109
and very low on the corner zero and one.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.159
Now, let's say we toss the coin 20 times and we get 10 heads, 10 tails.

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:52.144
Now, we have a bit more confidence that the coin is fair.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:55.605
So, the distribution for the new value p is something more like

00:00:55.604 --> 00:00:59.099
this graph with a higher peak at 0.5.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.260
Now, let's say we toss a coin four times,

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:04.355
and we get heads three times, and tails one.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:08.240
The probability distribution for p is now centered at

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:12.184
0.75 since we get three heads out of four tries.

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:14.120
But also with not much confidence.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.795
So, it's a graph like this.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:17.900
But if we toss it 400 times,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.755
and it lands on heads 300,

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:24.119
then we're much more confident that the value of p is close to 0.5.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.260
Therefore, the probability distribution for p is something like

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.290
this with a huge peak at at 0.75,

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.865
and almost flat everywhere else.

00:01:31.864 --> 00:01:33.989
This is called a Beta distribution,

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.609
and it works for any values of A and B.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.989
If we get heads A times and tails B times,

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:44.294
the graph looks like this with a peak at A over A+B.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:45.870
The formula is this.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.680
Gamma of A plus B,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.570
divided by Gamma of A times Gamma of B,

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.969
times X to the A minus one,

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.454
times Y to the B minus one.

00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:57.609
If you haven't seen the Gamma function,

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:00.849
think of it as a continuous version of the factorial function.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.409
In this case, if A is an integer,

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.875
then Gamma of A is A minus one factorial.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:10.300
For example, Gamma of five is four factorial,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.064
which is 24, and Gamma of six is five factorial, which is 120.

00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:18.050
But the interesting thing about

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.400
the Gamma function is that it also takes values in between.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.125
So, we can define things like Gamma of 5.5,

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:28.425
and it will be something between 24 and 120.

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:30.920
The actual formula for the Gamma function is in

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.544
the instructor comments although is not something we'll use in this class.

00:02:34.544 --> 00:02:37.919
So, what happens if we have values that are not integers like say,

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.875
0.1 for heads, and 0.4 for tails.

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:45.775
This makes no sense since we can get 0.1 heads and 0.4 tails.

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:48.395
But that's okay for the Beta distribution.

00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:52.460
We just need to grab the right formula using the Gamma function.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.460
For values smaller than one,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.320
like 0.1 and 0.4,

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.014
we get this graph.

00:02:58.014 --> 00:03:01.399
That means p is much more likely to be either close

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.789
to zero or close to one than to be in the middle.

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.564
This makes a bit of sense, right?

00:03:06.564 --> 00:03:09.224
If p is closer to zero or to one,

00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:13.250
then we're likely to have either zero heads or zero tails,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.530
which at least gets us close to one of the values 0.1 or 0.4.
