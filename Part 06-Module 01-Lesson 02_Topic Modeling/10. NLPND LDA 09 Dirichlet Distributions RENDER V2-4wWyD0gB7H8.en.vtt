00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
Now, a Multinomial Distribution is simply

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.700
a generalization of the binomial distribution to more than two values.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.990
For example, let's say we have newspaper articles and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.940
three topics: science, politics, and sports.

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:18.254
Let's say each topic is assigned randomly to the articles, and when we look,

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.044
we have three science articles,

00:00:20.045 --> 00:00:23.520
six politics articles, and two sports articles.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.149
So, for a new article,

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:29.739
what would the probability be that it's science, politics, or sports?

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.899
We would imagine it's a bit higher for politics and science,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.004
and higher for science and sports.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:36.679
This is not for sure,

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.314
but it's likely to happen.

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:41.000
So now, these three probabilities live in

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.030
a triangle where if we pick a point than any of the corners,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.435
it means the probability for that topic is one,

00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:47.705
and the others are zero,

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:49.210
and if we pick it in the middle,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.255
then the probabilities are similar for the three topics.

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:55.070
So, maybe the probability density distribution

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.159
for these three probabilities will be like this one here,

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.369
since articles are more likely to be politics than anything else,

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.299
and less likely to be sports than anything else.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.189
This probability density distribution is calculated with

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.989
a generalization of the formula for the Beta distribution given here.

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.819
It's called a Dirichlet distribution.

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:18.024
Again, there is no reason for these numbers to have to be integers.

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:21.020
For example, if we have 0.7, 0.7,

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:24.405
and 0.7, this is the Dirichlet distribution.

00:01:24.405 --> 00:01:27.060
It's hard to see, but the density function is very

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.969
high when we get really close to the corners of the triangle.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.189
Meaning that any point picked randomly from

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.090
this distribution is very likely to fall either at the science,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359
politics, or sports corners,

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.739
or at least close to any of the edges,

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:43.274
and very unlikely to be somewhere in the middle.

00:01:43.275 --> 00:01:47.275
Here are some samples of Dirichlet distributions with different values.

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:49.040
Notice that if the values are large,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.900
the density function is high in the middle,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.335
and if they're small, it's higher in the corners.

00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:55.569
If the values are different from each other,

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.839
then the high part moves towards the smaller values,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.775
and away from the larger values.

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:01.640
This is how they look in 3D.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.519
So, notice that if we want a good topic model,

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:07.314
we need to pick small parameters like the one on the left.

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:09.870
This is how we'll pick our topics from now on.
