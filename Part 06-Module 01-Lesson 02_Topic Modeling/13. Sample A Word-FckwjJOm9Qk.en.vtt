00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Now, we'll do the same thing for topics and words.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.925
Let's say for the sake of visualization that we only have four words: space,

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.839
climate, vote, and rule.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.570
Now we have a different distribution, beta.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.050
This one is similar to the previous one but it is three-dimensional,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.045
is not around a triangle but it's around a simplex.

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:25.580
Again, the red parts are high probability and the blue parts are low probability.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.089
If we had more words,

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.414
we would still have a very clear distribution except it would

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:32.024
be in a much higher dimensional simplex.

00:00:32.024 --> 00:00:36.079
This is why we picked four words because we can visualize that simplex in 3D.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.280
So, in this distribution beta,

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.039
we pick a random point and it will very likely be

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.570
close to a corner or an edge. Let's say it's here.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.280
This point generates the following multinomial distribution,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.700
0.4 for space, 0.4 for climate,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.990
and 0.1 for vote and rule.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.060
This multinomial distribution we'll be called phi and it

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.715
represents the connections between the words and the topic.

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:02.490
Now from this distribution,

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.504
we will sample random words which are 40 percent likely to be space,

00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:10.274
40 for climate, 10 for vote and 10 for rule.

00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:12.359
The words could look like this.

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.459
Now we do this for every topic.

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:18.094
So, Topic 1 is say around here close to Space and Climate,

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.469
topic 2 is here close to vote,

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.685
and on topic 3 is here close to rule.

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:26.500
Notice that we don't know what topics they are,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.109
we just know them as topic 1, 2, and 3.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:32.840
After some inspection, we can infer that topic

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.965
1 being close to Space and Climate must be science.

00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:41.015
Similarly, topic 2 being close to vote could be Politics,

00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:44.314
and topic 3 being close to rule could be sports.

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:47.730
But this is something that we'd be doing at the end of the model.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.250
And as a final step,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.000
we join these three together to obtain our other matrix in the LDA model.
