00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.609
Now, we'll do the same thing for topics and words.

00:00:02.609 --> 00:00:07.918
Let's say for the sake of visualization that we only have four words: space,

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:10.830
climate, vote, and rule.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.538
Now, we have a different Dirichlet distribution, beta.

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:17.969
This one is similar to the previous one but it is three-dimensional,

00:00:17.969 --> 00:00:21.039
it's not around a triangle but it's around a simplex.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.509
Again, the red parts are high probability and the blue parts are low probability.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.130
If we had more words,

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:29.349
we would still have a Dirichlet distribution except it would

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.960
be in a much higher dimensional simplex.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.355
This is why we've picked four words because we can visualize that simplex in 3D.

00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:38.198
So, in this distribution, beta,

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.990
we pick a random point and it will very likely be

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.060
close to a corner or an edge. Let's say, it's here.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.054
This point generates the following multinomial distribution: 0.4 for space,

00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:53.969
0.4 for climate, and 0.1 for vote and rule.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.768
This multinomial distribution will be called phi,

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.640
and it represents the connections between the words and the topic.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.500
Now from this distribution,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.474
we'll sample random words which are 40 percent likely to be space,

00:01:06.474 --> 00:01:10.254
40 for climate, 10 for vote and 10 for rule.

00:01:10.254 --> 00:01:12.310
The words could look like this.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.545
Now, we do this for every topic.

00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:17.820
So topic one is say around here close to space and climate,

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:20.618
topic two is here close to vote,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.680
and topic three is here close to rule.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.475
Notice that we don't know what topics they are,

00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:30.073
we just know them as topic one, two and three.

00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:32.820
After some inspection, we can infer that topic

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.959
one being close to space and climate must be science.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.094
Similarly, topic two being close to vote could be politics.

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:44.214
Topic three being close to rule could be sports.

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:48.359
But this is something that we'd be doing at the end of the model.

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:50.768
As a final step, we join these three together to

00:01:50.769 --> 00:01:54.000
obtain our other matrix in the LDA model.
