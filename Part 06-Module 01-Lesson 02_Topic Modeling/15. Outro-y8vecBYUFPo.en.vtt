00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.995
That's it. Great job.

00:00:01.995 --> 00:00:04.470
In this lesson, we've learned topic model and

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:08.320
document categorization using Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.740
This will give us the mixture model of topics in

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.004
a new document and the probabilities of these topics generating all the words.

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:16.789
Now, in the following lab,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.364
you'll be able to put all this in practice by applying

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:23.599
LDA to a set of documents and splitting them into topics.
