00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Let's start by picking some topics for our documents.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.185
We start with some declared distribution with parameters Alpha.

00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:10.744
And the parameters should be small for the distribution to be spiky towards the sites.

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:14.454
Which means, if we pick a point somewhere in the distribution,

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:18.585
it will most likely be close to a corner or at least to an edge.

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.990
Let's say we pick this point close to the politics corner which

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.889
generates the following values 0.1 for Science,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.505
0.8 for politics and 0.1 for sports.

00:00:29.504 --> 00:00:33.820
These values represent a mixture of topics for this particular document.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.564
They also give us a multinomial distribution theta.

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:39.439
Now from this distribution,

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.164
we'll start picking topics.

00:00:41.164 --> 00:00:46.609
That means the topics we'll pick are Science with a 10 percent probability,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.539
politics with an 80 percent probability and sports with a 10 percent probability.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.049
So, we'll pick some topics say politics,

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:56.919
science, politics, sports etc.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.890
And we do this for several documents.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.890
So, each document is a point in this declared distribution.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.984
Let's say document one is here which gives us this multinomial distribution.

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:11.750
Then, document two is here which gives us this other one,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.129
and we'll do this for all the documents.

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:17.810
And now, we merge all these vectors to get the first matrix.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.799
The matrix that indexes documents with their corresponding topics.
