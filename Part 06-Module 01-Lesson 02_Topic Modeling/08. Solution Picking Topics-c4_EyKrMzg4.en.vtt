00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
So let's think. In the distribution on the left,

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.370
we're very likely to pick a point, say,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.265
here close to a corner or the edges.

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:11.480
Let's say, for example, close to politics.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.884
That means our article is 80 percent about politics,

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:16.300
10 percent about sports,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.285
and 10 percent about science.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.829
On the distribution in the middle,

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.009
we can pick any point with equal probability.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.140
Say, this document, which is 40 percent about science,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.629
40 percent about politics,

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:28.744
and 20 percent about sports.

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:30.560
On the distribution on the right,

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:33.899
we're very likely to pick points in the middle like this document,

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.100
which is almost an equal probability science, sports, and politics.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.664
That would happen for all the articles we would pick.

00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:44.905
They would be points in these probability distributions. So let's think.

00:00:44.905 --> 00:00:46.814
If we have a bunch of articles,

00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:52.075
would the articles be more likely to be about one topic or three topics at the same time?

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:55.375
Well, most articles are about only one thing;

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.048
either science, sports or politics.

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:00.329
Some few articles are about two topics,

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.370
and almost no article will be about the three topics at the same time.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.655
Therefore, the most likely distribution for topics is the one in the left.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:11.224
So, this is what we'll do.

00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:12.640
For our LDA model,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.674
we'll pick a Dirichlet distribution with small parameters Alpha

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:19.224
such as 0.7, 0.7, and 0.7.

00:01:19.224 --> 00:01:23.204
From here, we'll sample a few points to be our documents.

00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:26.584
Each point gives us a vector of mixture probabilities, Theta,

00:01:26.584 --> 00:01:31.144
then we'll characterize the distribution of topics for that particular document.

00:01:31.144 --> 00:01:34.484
This is how Dirichlet distributions look like in 3D.

00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:37.620
The probability of picking a point on the triangle depends on

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.685
the height of the probability distribution at that point.

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:44.530
Therefore, we want to pick our topics from the model on the left.
