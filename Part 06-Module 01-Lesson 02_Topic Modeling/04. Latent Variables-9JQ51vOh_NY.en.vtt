00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Well, the answer is, we need one arrow for each pair document word.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.195
Since we have 500 documents and 1,000 words,

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:11.875
the number of parameters is the number of documents times the number of words.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:16.469
This is 500 times 1,000, which is 500,000.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:18.890
This is too many parameters to figure out.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.024
Is there any way we can reduce this number and still keep most of the information?

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.750
The answer is yes. We can reduce the number of

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.320
parameters and still catch most of the information.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.530
We'll do this by adding to the model the notion of a small set of topics or

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.730
latent variables that actually drive the generation of words in each document.

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:38.320
So, in this model,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.980
any document is considered to have an underlying mixture of topics associated with it.

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.709
Similarly, a topic is considered to be a mixture of terms that is likely to generate.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.645
In here, we have say three topics: Science, politics, and sports.

00:00:52.645 --> 00:00:54.790
So now, there are two sets of parameters of

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.325
probability distributions that we need to compute.

00:00:57.325 --> 00:01:02.234
The probability of a topic given a document d or

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:09.625
P(z/d) and the probability of a term P given a topic z, or P(t/z).

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.750
Our new probability of a document given a term can be

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.504
expressed as a sum over the two previous probabilities.

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:18.149
We'll see more about this later.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.465
So, it's time for another quiz.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.525
If we have 500 documents,

00:01:22.525 --> 00:01:25.225
10 topics and 1,000 words,

00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:28.164
how many parameters does this new model have?

00:01:28.165 --> 00:01:30.070
Enter your answer below.
