00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.305
So, now let's build our LDA model.

00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:03.860
The idea is the following;

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:05.365
We'll have our documents here,

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:07.474
let's say these three documents,

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.855
and then we'll generate some fake documents,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:11.464
like this three over here.

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:14.339
The way we generate them is with the topic model,

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.240
and then what we do is we compare the generated documents with the real ones.

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:24.324
This will tell us how far we are from creating the real documents with our model.

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.199
Like in most Machine Learning algorithms,

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.234
we learned from these error and we'll be able to improve her topic model.

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:35.799
This is what we'll do, in the paper the topic model is drawn like this,

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:40.129
this looks complicated but we'll analyze this in the next few videos
