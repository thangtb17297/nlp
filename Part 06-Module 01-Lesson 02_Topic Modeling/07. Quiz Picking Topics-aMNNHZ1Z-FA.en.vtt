00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.695
Let's sidetrack a bit.

00:00:01.695 --> 00:00:05.955
Let's say we're at a party and this party is in the triangular room,

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.990
and these black dots are people and they're roaming around the party.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.519
Now let's say we locate some food in a corner,

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.410
some dessert in the other corner and some music in the other one.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.760
So people get drawn to these corners and start walking towards them.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.225
Some people like music,

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:23.765
others food, others dessert.

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:26.280
Some people like this point on the left are undecided

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.205
between food and dessert. So they stay in the middle.

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:34.089
But normally they tend to walk to the red areas and away from the blue ones.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.035
Now let's say we do the opposite.

00:00:36.034 --> 00:00:37.984
We put a lion in one corner,

00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:42.100
fire on the other one and radioactive waste in the other one.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.950
So now people will do the opposite.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.615
They'll stay away from the corners and gravitate towards a center.

00:00:47.615 --> 00:00:51.090
They tend to go to the red area which is now in the middle,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.715
and stay away from the blue areas.

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:55.630
So we have our three scenarios.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.515
When we put nice things on the corners,

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.734
when we put nothing and we put dangerous things.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.905
These are examples of dirichlet distributions.

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:06.060
In these triangles the dots have

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.500
more probability of being in the red areas than in the blue ones.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.254
We'll see more on this later but dirichlet distributions have parameter at the corners.

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:17.159
If the parameters are small say 0.70,

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.864
0.7, and 0.7 then we get the one on the left.

00:01:20.864 --> 00:01:23.519
If they're all ones then we get the one in the middle

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:27.204
and if they're all big say five then we get the one on the right.

00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:30.344
We can think of the parameters as repelling factors.

00:01:30.344 --> 00:01:33.769
If they are large, they pushed the points away and if they're

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:38.049
small they pulled the points closer to them. So here's a quiz.

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.834
If the black dots are documents and the corners of the triangle or three topics;

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:45.015
science, politics and sports.

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:49.390
Which of these distributions would be the best one for picking our documents?

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.500
This is a slightly vague question,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.400
but try to go with your intuition.
