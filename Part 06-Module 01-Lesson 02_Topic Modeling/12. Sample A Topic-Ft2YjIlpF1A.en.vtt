00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Let's start by picking some topics for our documents.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.179
We start with some Dirichlet distribution with parameters alpha,

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:09.059
and the parameter should be small for the distribution to be

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.734
spiky towards the sides, which means,

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:14.429
if we pick a point somewhere in the distribution,

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.559
it will most likely be close to a corner or at least to an edge.

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:21.719
Let's say we pick this point close to the politics corner,

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.719
which generates the following values;

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:27.504
0.1 for science, 0.8 for politics,

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:29.493
and 0.1 for sports.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:33.765
These values represent the mixture of topics for this particular document.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:37.189
They also give us a multinomial distribution data.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:39.320
Now, from this distribution,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.085
we'll start picking topics.

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:44.594
That means the topics we'll pick are science,

00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:47.478
with a 10 percent probability, politics,

00:00:47.478 --> 00:00:49.213
with an 80 percent probability,

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:51.525
and sports with a 10 percent probability.

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:53.460
So, we'll pick some topics, say,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.064
politics, science, politics, sports,

00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:58.829
etc., and we do this for several documents,

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.878
so each document is a point in this Dirichlet distribution.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.625
Let's say document one is here,

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:07.980
which gives us this multinomial distribution,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.760
and document two is here,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.445
which gives us this other one,

00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:14.109
and, we do this for all the documents.

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:17.783
And now, we merge all these vectors to get the first matrix,

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:21.799
the matrix that indexes documents with their corresponding topics.
