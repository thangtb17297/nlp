00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
Let's start with a regular bag of words model.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.900
If you think about the Bag of Words model graphically,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.115
it represents the relationship between a set of

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:10.675
document objects and a set of word objects.

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:13.685
It's very simple. Let's say we've got an article like this

00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.219
one and we look at what words are in that article.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.890
We'll assume that we do the correct stemming and text

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.714
processing so that we only look at the important words.

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:27.460
So this article has three words namely space, vote and explore.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.530
The word space appears twice,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.329
the word vote appears once and the word explore or it's

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.449
related words like exploration appears three times.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.150
To find the probabilities of each word appearing in the article,

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.979
we divide by the total number of words and we get some probabilities.

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.289
This gives us three parameters.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.409
Now to add some notation, we call documents d,

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.809
our words or terms t and the parameters

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.219
are precisely the probability of a word appearing in the documents,

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.875
so that is P of t given d. Specifically this parameter say,

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:02.509
for any given document d and observed term t.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:06.754
How likely is it that the document d generated the term t?

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:10.530
So now we do this for a bunch of documents and a bunch of words.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.099
We draw all these probabilities. And let's have a quiz.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:18.129
Let's say we have 500 documents and 1000 unique words.

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:21.015
How many parameters are in this model?

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:23.200
Enter your answer below.
