00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359
You've learned a lot about speech audio.

00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:05.790
We've introduced signal analysis and feature

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.910
extraction techniques to create data representations for that speech audio.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.548
Now, we need a lot of examples of audio,

00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:15.855
matched with text, the labels,

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.875
that we can use to create our dataset.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:20.992
If we have those labeled examples,

00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:24.179
say a string of words matched with an audio snippet,

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.394
we can turn the audio into spectrograms or

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:32.229
MFCC representations for training a probabilistic model.

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.929
Fortunately for us, ASR is a problem that a lot of people have worked on.

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.250
That means there is labeled audio data available to us and there are

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.439
lots of tools out there for converting sound into various representations.

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:49.409
One popular benchmark datasource for ASR training and

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.359
testing is the TIMIT Acoustic-Phonetic Corpus.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.079
This data was developed specifically for speech research in 1993 and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.472
contains 630 speakers voicing 10 phoneme-rich sentences each,

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:08.170
sentences like, 'George seldom watches daytime movies.'

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.609
Two popular large vocabulary data sources are the LDC Wall Street Journal Corpus,

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:18.269
which contains 73 hours of newspaper reading,

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:21.875
and the freely available LibriSpeech Corpus,

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:25.454
with 1000 hours of readings from public domain books.

00:01:25.454 --> 00:01:29.310
Tools for converting these various audio files into spectrograms and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.855
other feature sets are available in a number of software libraries.

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:36.075
In the following lab, you'll explore

00:01:36.075 --> 00:01:41.784
some dataset samples as well as create some audio files and data of your own.

00:01:41.784 --> 00:01:44.804
You can even take a look at the spectrograms

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:48.000
with an open-source visualization tool. Have fun.
