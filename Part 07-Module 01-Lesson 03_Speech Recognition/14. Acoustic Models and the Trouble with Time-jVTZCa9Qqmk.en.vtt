00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.754
We've got our data now.

00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:04.769
With feature extraction, we've addressed noise problems due to

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:08.695
environmental factors as well as variability of speakers.

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:13.635
Phonetics gives us a representation for sounds and language that we can map to.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:18.329
That mapping, from the sound representation to the phonetic representation,

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.359
is the task of our acoustic model.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.625
We still haven't solved the problem of matching variable lengths of the same word.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:30.320
We've talked about this problem before in another lesson,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.780
when the dynamic time warping algorithm was introduced.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.359
To recap, DTW calculates the similarity between two signals,

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.295
even if their time lengths differ.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.075
This can be used in speech recognition, for instance,

00:00:45.075 --> 00:00:48.359
to align the sequence data of a new word to

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.545
its most similar counterpart in a dictionary of word examples.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:54.240
As we'll soon see,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.020
hidden Markov models are well-suited for solving this type

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.640
of time series pattern sequencing within an acoustic model, as well.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.519
This characteristic explains their popularity in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.524
speech recognition solutions for the past 30 years.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.380
If we choose to use deep neural networks for our acoustic model,

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:15.899
the sequencing problem reappears.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.415
We can address the problem with a hybrid HMM/DNN system,

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:23.250
or we can solve it another way.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.150
Later, we'll talk about how we can solve the problem in DNNs with

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.340
connectionist temporal classification or CTC.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.530
First though, we'll review HMMs and how they're used in speech recognition.
