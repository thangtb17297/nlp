00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Congratulations on completing the speech recognition module.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.075
We've covered a lot of ground.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:10.769
We started with signal analysis taking apart the sound characteristics of the signal,

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.059
and extracting only the features we required to decode the sounds and the words.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.370
We learned how the features could be mapped to

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.775
sound representations of phonemes with HMM models,

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:25.875
and how language models increase accuracy when decoding words and sentences.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:30.809
Finally, we shifted our paradigm and looked into the future of speech recognition,

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:36.000
where we may not need feature extraction or separate language models at all.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.274
Now, you're ready to implement your capstone project.

00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:43.920
I hope you've enjoyed learning this subject as much as I've enjoyed teaching it.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.000
This one's for you, an end to end ASR using deep neural networks. Enjoy.
